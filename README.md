Exif-Scout
==========

The Exif-Scout is a C++-Program for offline searching through the exif-data of images. You can select various exif-data as search parameters and the Exif-Scout searches through your offline media.

Exif-Scout is a program I have written as a universities class project some years ago. I wanted to save it before it gets lost. Therefore you have the oppotunity to check Exif-Scout out!

WARNING
=======

This project is not jet working because the makefiles need to be adjusted. As a result of bad makefile generation (by eclipse) the makefiles have the needed lib-directorys hardcoded (e.g. /usr/share/qt4/mkspecs/linux-g++). Therefore here is some work necessary before the project can be used. Sorry for that - but thats over my makefile-knowledge for know... Some help would be nice here.

The Exiv2-Library may be needed on you system (http://www.exiv2.org/download.html).



FILES
=====

Makefile 		- was once used for comiling in linux
Makefile.Debug		- was once used for comiling in Windows
Makefile.Release	- was once used for comiling in Windows
